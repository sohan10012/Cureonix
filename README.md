# Cureonix – Pharma Intelligence Platform

## Overview

**Cureonix** is an AI-powered Pharma Intelligence platform designed to transform fragmented pharmaceutical data into actionable, structured insights. It serves as an intelligent discovery and analysis layer for pharmaceutical R&D, strategy, and regulatory teams by unifying market data, patents, clinical trials, and research literature into a single decision-support system.

The platform is built with a **Flutter-based mobile interface** and a **modular, configurable AI backend**, enabling deep pharmaceutical analysis without coupling intelligence logic to the UI.

Cureonix addresses core industry challenges such as information overload, siloed research data, slow discovery cycles, and inefficient drug repurposing workflows .
